# OpenWrt Tools, Modifications, and Documentation

This is a collection of scripts, configurations, and assorted wisdom (or at least semi-coherent notes).

Some of this is my own original work, some of it is modified from other's code, and some of it is just me looking at existing solutions and thinking, *"I can probably break this in a more interesting way."*

Instead of letting these gems of troubleshooting and tinkering gather dust on my local drive, I figured someone else might find them useful. Or at least amusing.

If you find something useful, have at it. If you have improvements, feel free to open an issue (if only to have a discussion about it).

## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer (a.k.a. "Proceed at Your Own Risk")

By using anything from this repository, you acknowledge that:
- You are responsible for whatever happens.
- I am **not** responsible for whatever happens.
- If something breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

I have made a reasonable effort to ensure that the contents of this repository don't summon gremlins into your router. However, I make **zero guarantees** that anything here won't crash your network, start thermonuclear war, or cause your cat to judge you more than usual.

Code formatting is a best effort. I try to blend in modifications with the existing formatting, for original work I follow *my own* best practices. And sometimes it's just whatever got the job done. Commenting is equally inconsistent: Some parts may have excessive, borderline-philosophical explanations, while others assume you can read my mind.

## ðŸ¤” Why Isnâ€™t Any of This Upstream?

There are many reasons why none of this has been upstreamed into official OpenWrt code. Some of it is too niche and realistically only useful to myself and maybe two other weirdos, some of it works fine but isnâ€™t *technically* the "right" way to do things, and some of it I actually *did* try to upstreamâ€”only to be met with indifference. Rather than spend my time chasing approvals, I figured itâ€™s easier to just put everything here, where I can maintain it with exactly as much (or as little) effort as I feel like.

That said, if you think something here *should* be upstreamed, feel free to give it a shot! Just donâ€™t be surprised if you end up in the same boat.
